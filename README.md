# CRUD-commenting-element-First-attempt-
This is my first attempt at building out a full CRUD application. This project is the next step-up from my previous repo (https://github.com/WillUK99/Express-EJS-subreddit-mockup).

## Technologies.
-HTML -JS -Node.JS -Express -EJS -Bootstrap -CSS.

### About.
This is my first attempt at creating a fully functioning CRUD application. Utilising Express it was fairly straight forward implementing my RESTful routes, the only issue I ran into during the routing stage was patching through the edit.ejs payload. To get around this I installed method-override to trick html into doing what I needed it too...
